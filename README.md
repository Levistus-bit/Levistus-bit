- 👋 Hi, I’m @Levistus-bit
- 👀 I’m interested in the applications of dynamic programming with machine learning in cybersecurity (but more realistically games).
- 🌱 I currently code in Python and Java, but looking to learn C++ soon.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything currently, I like working alone on code.
- 📫 You can reach me in Github if you really want to collaborate or just talk about code.
- 😄 Pronouns: any
- ⚡ Fun fact: In addition to coding, I row and wrestle to stop myself from becoming a vegetable.
